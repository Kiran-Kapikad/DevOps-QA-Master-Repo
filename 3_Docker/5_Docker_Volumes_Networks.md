# Docker Volumes and Networks

Volumes and networks are key to managing **data persistence** and **communication** between containers in Docker environments. This section explains both.

## ðŸ”¹ Docker Volumes

Docker **volumes** are used to persist data generated by and used by containers. They live outside the container lifecycle and are not deleted when a container is removed (unless explicitly done).

### Why use volumes?

* Data persistence
* Sharing data between containers
* Simplifies backups and migrations

### Common Commands:

```bash
docker volume create myvolume             # Create a volume
docker volume ls                          # List volumes
docker volume inspect myvolume            # View volume details
docker volume rm myvolume                 # Remove a volume
```

### Using Volumes in Containers:

```bash
docker run -d -v myvolume:/data myapp     # Mount named volume to /data
```

You can also mount host directories:

```bash
docker run -d -v $(pwd):/app myapp        # Mount current directory into container
```

## ðŸ”¹ Docker Networks

Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other and with external systems. There are different types of networks available.

### Types of Docker Networks:

* **Bridge (default):** Used for standalone containers on a single host.
* **Host:** Uses the hostâ€™s networking directly (Linux-only).
* **None:** No network.
* **Overlay:** For multi-host communication (Swarm mode).
* **Macvlan:** Assigns a MAC address to container (advanced use).

### Common Commands:

```bash
docker network ls                         # List networks
docker network create mynet               # Create custom network
docker network inspect mynet              # Inspect a network
docker network rm mynet                   # Remove network
```

### Connecting Containers to Network:

```bash
docker run -d --name app1 --network=mynet myapp
```

Containers on the same bridge or custom network can access each other by name:

```bash
ping app1
```

## âœ… Summary

* Use **volumes** to persist and share data.
* Use **networks** to enable communication between containers.
* These are essential for real-world applications, especially in microservices and CI/CD pipelines.
