## 🧪 Bonus: How It Helps QA

- Feature branches allow isolated testing
- Hooks stop bad code before it hits staging
- Branching models make it easy to control what gets released
- `.gitignore` ensures test logs and local settings aren’t committed

## ✅ Final Tips

- Use meaningful branch names (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`)
- Set up hooks for all team members
- Keep your local `develop` branch updated
